1644 Meakan (Nemuro), not Ishikari (Sapporo), is now the target of the Hokkaido gold rush. The Konomai gold mine is located there, not in Sapporo.
1643 Ishikari (Sapporo) now shifts to coal after 1870
	The Ishikari coalfield contains the largest quantity of coal of Japan. Coal was discovered there in 1868 and mining began in 1874.
	Japanese coal is found in the extreme ends of the country, in Hokkaidō and Kyūshū, which have, respectively, 45 and 40 percent of the country's coal deposits. Kyūshū's coal is generally of poor quality and hard to extract, but the proximity of the Kyūshū mines to ports facilitates transportation. In Hokkaido, the seams are wider, can be worked mechanically, and offer a higher-quality coal.
1104 Sheki now starts as silk (instead grain) and no longer shifts to oil
	Sheki had a significant silk industry, and the Baku oil fields don't go that far inland anyways
	"During 1850–70, Shaki became international silk production centre.[39] More than 200 European companies opened offices in the city, while silkworms to the tune of 3 million roubles were sold to them in a year.[39]"
	https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20230816-sheki-the-caucasus-unsung-culture-capital
	There is evidence of sericulture (silkworm breeding and silk production) in the region dating back to the 6th Century, but it was the Sheki khans who turned it into a thriving business. "By the 18th and 19th Centuries, Sheki silk was considered amongst the finest in the world," said Gudratli.

Slightly less coal, slightly more iron. Coal shouldn't much surpluses before 1900 (coal is the limiting factor in industralization, but there is still more coal than in v0.5.8n). Iron surplus/unemployment is allowed, this tweak is to get the timing right. (Iron overproduction caused the Long Depression)

	Added new province modifier: local_reapers_und_soil_enrichment unlocked by carbon_soil_enrichment and hussey_n_mccormicks_reaping_machine. It is unreasonable that heavy machinery like reapers and advanced artifical fertilizers can spread into some backwater colony immediately after it is invented. This modifier DOES spread into slave states, unlike tractors.
	Tractors now only spread to provinces that already have local_reapers_und_soil_enrichment - mechanization is a slow process!

Monitors no longer use fuel, instead, they just use oil.

scripted AI Japan and several daimyo to make them take the western shipyard reform if commodore perry's expedition is successful
The winner of the Boshin War (or if Tokugawa unites Japan peacefully) gains an ironclad and a maximum of 4 ships from each of the daimyo
When the Ezo Republic is founded they also gain an admiral Enomoto Takeaki (expert, war college) and the reminants of the Tokugawa navy: 4 Steam Frigates and 4 Troopships (or Frigates and Clipper Transports if they don't have the relevant inventions)

added 4 Qing naval bases (Lüshun, Shanghai, Fuzhou, and Canton), 16 frigates, and 2 clipper transports (compared to 8 naval bases, 5 man-of-wars, and 20 frigates in older versions of HPM) because the Qing did have permanent fleets, several of which did a "large-scale sea patrol" every year.
	Fengtian Navy: Lüshun
	Shandong Navy: There were bases in Dengzhou (Weihaiwei) and Jiaozhou (Qingdao). However, the source does not mention anything past 1753 so to prevent the Qing navy from being too large these naval bases are NOT included.
	Zhili Navy: Tianjin. The fleet was shut down for corruption and renamed the "Daigu Navy" but still "was far smaller than the Shandong or Fengtian navies" so this naval base is NOT included
	Jiangsu navy, Jiangnan Naval Force: Shanghai 
	Zhejiang Navy: Adding a naval base in, say, Jiaxing, would be too close to Shanghai and to prevent the Qing navy from being too big this naval base is NOT included.

Vietnam now starts with forts in Hanoi, Hue, and Saigon, as well as 2 clipper frigates.
	From 1802 to 1821, Vietnam built Vauban-style pre-napoleonic forts, the first two under the direction of French officers. After 1821, one of the French officers brought new books back from France and Vietnam began building polygonal post-napoleonic forts. Vietnam also had many European-style ships but disbanded most of them in 1802. Only 2 ships remained in the 1810s, but ship construction increased again in 1819. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022463403000468 
	George Finlayson, during the Crawfurd expedition of 1821, commented that "Hué, is surrounded by fortifications that would do credit to the first fortress in Europe" and built "according to the principles of European fortification. https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/45505/pg45505-images.html
	US Navy Lieutenant John White visited Vietnam in 1819 and saw the Saigon citadel and "two frigates of European construction, under the superintendance of French officers" as well as about 200 galleys. https://archive.org/details/voyagetocochinch00whitrich

Removed the Hawthorne Study invention because it is already covered by Human Resource Development
Removed the closed economy invention because it is already covered by Autarky
rocket_experiments now give prestige instead of increasing paper production
general_computer_programming moved to Structuralism, now gives 0.05 education_efficiency instead of increasing electric gear production
miniature_vacuum_tube now adds 0.03 electric gear, like the regular vacuum tube invention

leaded_gasoline now reduces education_efficiency even further
mass_surveillance now also reduces rebel organization, like secret police and the police state 
national_liberation now also increases nationalist_rebels by 0.17 (the separatism gave them 0.33 organization, 0.33+0.17 = 0.5, which makes rebel organization easier to calculate and compare)
moved anticolonialism from social thought to political thought, no longer gives consciousness and plurality, instead now gives independence and native rebels 0.5 organization

Hotfix: Improved performance of strategic bombing - nested loops are too demanding

v0.5.8h
Communists governments now love you and non-capitalists now hate you if you eat the rich
Simplified banning opium decisions and events by removing the local_opium_ban modifier. RGOs now change away from opium after 1 event, not after 2 convoluted events.
Made sure Hong Kong 1469 and Macau 1498 successfully transition away from opium if opium is banned 
Slowed down spread of opium RGOs but now you can no longer refuse
Capital punishment, not rehabilitation, now slows down the spread of drug addicts. Wtf was I thinking when I made this event?
Made sure trade zones become civilized when they get annexed when China civilizes so they don't become colonies
Made Guangdong not become KMT every single time - it should now be more random
If the Qing falls to the generic anti-Qing rebels, reforms are removed as per normal unciv reactionary rebels

v0.5.8g
Strategic bombing now needs the late_interwar_bombers invention as well as strategic_destruction_doctrine. You need to have invented planes with big payloads in order to bomb with them!
slowed down strategic bombing by 25%, made tech more important in speeding it up
Added a check for the year so the event doesn't gum up game performance way before bombers are invented
Intercontinental bombing is now much less likely
Czechoslovakia is now now longer a releasable vassal so Bohemia and Slovakia can no longer release it from themselves. Dismantling a country still makes Czechoslovakia appear as normal though.
slightly nerfed lubrication oil to reduce machine part overproduction
moved the fort of Chengde to the right position

Starting party loyalty has been reduced by 1/5, so election victories can overpower them over the course of the game. Since party loyalty changes by +0.1 if a party wins by 100% of the vote and there are elections every 4 years, it would take 1200 years of consecutive landslides to overpower a starting party loyalty of 30, which is clearly too long. 30 years of consecutive landslides will only add 0.75 party loyalty to a province! 
The power of the national focus has been divided by 3 to 0.001 per day, which is the power of nearly FOUR total 100% landslide victories per year. Now it would take about 10 years instead of 20 years to overpower the most common starting loyalty of 20 (reduced to 4).
The amount of party loyalty that is lost in scandals has also been divided by 4 so scandals don't immediately annihilate all local party loyalty.

Restored effect of railroads from 0.15 back to 0.16
removed seaplane_tenders invention because it's already covered by on_board_recon_aircraft, moved the 1 gun power cruisers get from it to improved_naval_aircraft, to represent the better recon planes mounted on cruisers too
miniature_vacuum_tube now boosts electric_gear production instead of radio and telephobes
Returned base coal and iron production to the HPM values
Re-enabled lubrication_oil, which also increases coal, iron, and sulphur by 0.05, representing how it protects mining equipment from dust.
air_preheater increases factory throughput instead of increasing fuel factory production again
Reduced industrial_plastics_production fabric and glass from 0.05 to 0.02, re-enabled its synthetic rubber boost

Several North German minors faught on Austria's side in the Austro-Prussian War:
	Hanover, Hesse-Kassel, Hesse-Darmstadt, and Frankfurt (as well as Saxony) are much less likely to turn to Prussia when they win the Second Schleswig War.
	Sphere changes of pro-Austrian North German minors:
		Hanover HAN				King Ernest Augustus was Pro-Austrian, had a trade war with Brunswick when Brunswick joined the Zollverein, and didn't join the Zollverein until 1851, starts in UK's sphere as usual, but Austria starts with much more inflence and Prussia much less
		Hesse-Kassel HEK		Pro-Austrian minister of justice and of the interior Hans Hassenpflug was in office in 1836, so starts in Austria's sphere
		Hesse-Darmstadt	HES	Interior minister von Dalwigk was very pro-Austrian, so starts in Austria's sphere
		Nassau NAS				used to be Pro-Austria but joined the Zollverein in 1835, so increased Austrian influence
		Frankfurt FRM			very anti-Prussian, and the Central Federal Bureau of Investigations was founded there by Prince Metternich after 1833 rebellion, so starts in Austria's sphere
		Saxe-Meiningen		in the Zollverein, not enough information to really decide so kept in Prussia's sphere

make Red Turbans no longer spread into North Han again
Generic anti-qing rebels winning also makes you lose research points like a normal unciv reactionary rebellion (but does not roll back reforms)

The Red Turbans can now pick to move their capital to Nanjing, Luoyang, Xi'an (renamed to Chang'an), or Chengdu if they win, instead of just Nanjing. The event picture is An illustration of the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, Fischer von Erlach's A Plan of Civil and Historical Architecture (1721)
Returned Anhui to its darker orange color because it was too difficult to tell it apart from Nationalist China's orange

Buffed the Skoda Works tech school so it gets 5% better commerce research so its total research bonus isn't worse than the other tech schools.

v0.5.8d
put the AI crutches in the triggered modifiers back in
Tainan (1485) no longer grows tea: tea is grown in the mountains of northern and central Taiwan, not on the fields of western Taiwan. Instead, it now grows fruit, which would also make pops in an independent Taiwan less likely to starve.
Taitung (2562) grows normal (instead of tropical) wood again, as in HPM. After the 1970s, it should flip to tea because of deforestation (currently disabled because the end date doesn't reach that far yet).

Local Modern Transportation now requires screw-propelled steamers and can now spread in slave states
Halved the tariff efficiency modifier of the Hormuz Strait, the Strait of Malacca, and the Bab-el-Maneb Strait. Just owning the land next should the strait shouldn't be nearly as effective for laying tariffs as owning the Suez Canal.

Removed juye incident events because they are already covered by the generic westerners killed events

If you're a gp, when you get a treaty port you can demand the area around it to become a tag that is an unreleasable vassal/substate of China, but in the sphere of whoever got the treaty port, this way treaty ports actually offer you access to cheap goods instead of just milking China personally for money. 
trade zones can be expanded around 1860, (after Taiping rebellion, 2nd opium war)
trade zones can be expanded again around 1895 (boxer rebellion)
if the trade zone no longer touches its China (QNG, RTR, CHI, TPG) overlord, the trade zone becomes the puppet of the China that touches it instead
The trade zone gets absorbed if: westernized neighboring east asian country OR treaty port is owned by an east asian OR trade zone is not in a sphere
the dragon wakes event automatically annexes vassal trade zones 
if trade zone is independent and civilized, it turns into its relevant clique
    East and West Shantung -> CHI Zhili Clique
    North and South Kiangsu, South Anhwei, Chekiang -> HUI Anhui Clique
    East and West Kwangtung -> GNG
Trade zones can NOT use the chinese reunification cb, but the cb can be used against them 
Trade zones and KMT can no longer be released by the vassal sphere coup decision 
Chinese substate tech now sharing works on trade zones (there is no release_substate or create_substate command so all trade zones are vassals, not substates)
TPG/RTR victory event: can choose to puppet existing trade zones or reject unequal treaties, letting the trade zones remain independent but unable to expand, but GPs with a treaty port get a free treaty port cb
boxers, if successful, can reabsorb the trade zones and prevent new ones from forming, and gives the modifier reactionary_demands for 1 year
If China loses a treaty port war or the Boxer rebellion intervention war, tore_up_unequal_treaties flag is cleared and treaty ports can expand again
Boxer rebellion intervention war, if won, lets the attacker get a treaty port

change FACTORY_PURCHASE_MIN_FACTOR = 0.5 to FACTORY_PURCHASE_MIN_FACTOR = 1.0
	"Basically vic 2 has a mechanic where as a demand for a good lowers a factory will begin lowering its' production over time, before it starts firing workers. The problem is the mechanic is glitched, once demand increases the production is meant to increase as well but it doesn't, it'll just stay low until you reload your save (for some reason reloading fixes it). In the base game production drops to 75% but HPM changes it to drop to 50%, meaning your factories will drop to half production and stay there when demand decreases if you don't reload. Even if the demand increases later the production will not increase to previous levels due to aforementioned glitch. There is a very simple fix which is to just stop factories from lowering production when there is oversupply in the market (they'll just go straight to firing workers when they are no longer turning a profit from not being able to sell goods). Common > Defines and change FACTORY_PURCHASE_MIN_FACTOR = 0.5 to FACTORY_PURCHASE_MIN_FACTOR = 1.0"

Oil production peaked in 1908 at 34 million barrels per year, and declined steadily to 5 million barrels in 1933.
